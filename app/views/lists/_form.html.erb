<!-- This form is a partial -->

<!-- In this view, we are using the Rails form_with helper to generate an HTML form to create/edit lists. 
 This helper uses a form builder to handle things like CSRF tokens, generating the URL based upon 
 the model: provided, and even tailoring the submit button text to the model. -->
